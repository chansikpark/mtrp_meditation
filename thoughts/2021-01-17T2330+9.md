An initial pass at a curriculum gradation; just off the top of my head, without considering risks, contingencies, subject screening (for starters, say, male professional athletes with good science literacy and excellent health insurance), etc.

#### Basic anatomy
- Some riveting and immediately applicable subset of A&P introductories
	
#### Settling in
- Anatomy lesson: vertebrae; bones
- Find a handful of comfortable postures; standing, sitting, lying down
	- Kyphosis; lordoses
	- Be ok with just breathing for a while
  
#### Proprioception
- Anatomy lesson: the nervous system
- Physiology lesson: respiratory & attentional coupling (..[nb. re: arousal](https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/trauma-meditation/); [ischiocavernosus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischiocavernosus_muscle#Structure)) ([qv.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29682753/)); "proprioception amplification"
- Intro to focal, locative, and undirected frames
	- focal: important to maintain steadiness of the shape and quality of sensation
	- locative: various strategies for homing in on specific locations of the body
	- undirected: equanimous, resting, open awareness
- Lateral walls of nose bridge, until there is tension or some conjurable sensation (maybe even use q-tips to gently locate)

#### Skin
- Anatomy lesson: dermatomes
- Segment-by-segment skin proprioception
	- locative fashioning (tracing, visualization, triangulation, connect-the-dots)
	- focal fashioning - loosen/weaken attention and gradually strengthen as possible	

#### Full breathing
- Anatomy lesson: Gross anatomy of the respiratory tract
- Physiology lesson: pulmonology; tingling
- Parimukhaá¹ƒ: full-throated; cranial innervations; respiratory tract
- Scope out the entire respiratory tract with some light locative, then switch to focal 
- Minding stretch receptors; smooth continuity between inhales and exhales

#### Inspiration
- Cranium

#### Cardiovascular
- Heart, large vessels (+thymus&thyroids)

#### Digestive
- Liver, stomach, kidneys, mesentery, bladder, the rest

#### More anatomy and physiology...

(speculative measurables...?)
