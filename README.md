> Meditation can lead people to some dark places, triggering trauma or leaving people feeling disoriented, according to Dr. Willoughby Britton, who has studied the adverse effects of contemplative practices for more than a decade. In May 2017, she and her research partner and husband, Dr. Jared Lindahl, released **a study that identified 59 different kinds of negative meditation experiences**. Their research has also shown that these distressing experiences are not limited to people who have a history of mental illness.

On additional consideration, "segmental_euphoric_autonomia" feels more apt. Mostly not to 'rule out' 'non-autonomia'.
